# Thin Democracy
Benjamin R. Barber(~2017) is a political strategist who authored "Strong Democracy." In his book, he coined the current malfunctioning democracy as a "Thin Democracy."
The Thin Democracy has several naive implementations that require politicians who often don't represent us. A root cause of that notorious reputation is the inefficient feedback loop.
Since that parliamentary system and the administrations don't have transparency, people can't point that out.
Additionally, since the congress has very few throughput of proposals, senators can't afford to deal with non-urgent improvement of the regulations and public services.
Those structural flaws of the Thin Democracy caused corruptions and rent-seekers.
